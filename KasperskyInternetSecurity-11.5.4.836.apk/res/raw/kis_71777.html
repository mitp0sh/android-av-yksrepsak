<p class="picturename">Shield in the center of the main window</p>
<p class="bodytext">The shield color changes with the status of device protection:</p>
<ul class="listbullet1"><li class="listbullet1">Green&nbsp;&ndash; the device is adequately protected. All protection components operate according to the settings recommended by Kaspersky Lab specialists. Kaspersky Internet Security databases are up to date. No malicious objects have been detected during a scan of the device, or all detected malicious objects have been neutralized by the app. </li><li class="listbullet1">Yellow &ndash; the level of protection is below normal, and there are certain problems in the operation of Kaspersky Internet Security. For example, the device has not been scanned for more than 14 days, or you have installed a new app that has not been scanned.</li><li class="listbullet1">Red&nbsp;&ndash; there are problems that may lead to infection of the device and loss of data. For example, certain protection components have been paused or anti-virus databases have not been updated for more than 14 days.</li></ul><p class="bodytext">By tapping the shield in the main app window, you can open the <span class="buttonscharacter">Status</span> section (see figure below).

<ul class="listbullet1"><li class="listbullet1"><em class="emphasischaracter">Notification problems</em>. Highlighted in yellow. Notification problems notify the user about events that can potentially affect device security (for example, the fact that the last scan was performed more than 14 days ago or that a new app has not been scanned). You can hide a notification problem by swiping it to the left. After this, information about the problem can be accessed via the <span class="buttonscharacter">Hidden problems</span> menu.</li><li class="listbullet1"><em class="emphasischaracter">Critical problems</em>. Highlighted in red. Critical problems notify the user about events of critical importance to device security (such as the release of a new app version or the fact that the anti-virus databases have not been updated for a long time). A critical problem cannot be hidden.</li></ul>
